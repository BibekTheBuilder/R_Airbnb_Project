# R_Airbnb_Project
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the potential relationship between geographical distribution and Airbnb pricing in Las Vegas. Statistical techniques including correlation and regression were employed. The main objective was to determine if a correlation existed between Airbnb prices and the distance from two key locations: the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown. While the initial raw data showed a moderate negative correlation between price and distance, the analysis results indicated a weak correlation between the distance from these locations and the prices of Airbnb listings.
